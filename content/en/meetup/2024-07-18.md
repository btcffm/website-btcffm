We hope for good weather this time and will meet at the "Liegewiese an der Weseler Werft" (`50.10775, 8.70107`, [Open Street Maps](https://www.openstreetmap.org/way/73510354), [Google Maps](https://maps.app.goo.gl/rZgMhJbkc1QGWpu38)) next to the European Central Bank. Bring blankets or other seating as there are not many benches. The sponsor for the beer is already found and fixed, so please bring some thirst as well as other food and drinks if needed!

In case of bad weather we still have the nearby indoor place as a backup.
