The Frankfurt Bitcoin Meetup is the continuation of the "original" Frankfurt
meetup started in 2013. We meet on every third Thursday.

From September through April we meet in a beautiful co-working space called
[Die Zentrale] in Frankfurt-Bornheim. During the summer, we'll meet somewhere
outside: In a public park, a BBQ place or a beer garden - your input on cool
locations is welcome!

[Die Zentrale]: https://die-zentrale-ffm.de/

We rely on donations to finance the location and drinks. You can contribute [here].
